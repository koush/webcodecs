        This sample test WebCodec hardwareAcceleration: deny's software decoder to reproduce
         a performance issue in YUV texture loading that occurs with texImage2d.
        
         <br/>
         The best way to reproduce this is running it in VMWare. But running Chrome with --disable-gpu also works too to see the performance issue.

         There are 3 pages that test 3 paths to draw the yuv texture from webcodec:
         <ul>
            <li><a href='drawImage.html'>drawImage</a> (works fine)</li>
            <li><a href='texImage2d.html'>webgl texImage2d</a> - built in color swizzle from yuv to rgb is extremely slow</li>
            <li><a href='yuvshader.html'>webgl yuvshader</a> - perform the yuv to rgb conversion in a shader using 3 luminance textures</li>
        </ul>
